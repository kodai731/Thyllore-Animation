//! Optional backend shim entry points for downstream integrations.
//!
//! These modules expose the repository-owned C shim ABI for selected official
//! Dear ImGui backends. They are intentionally low-level and unsafe.
//!
//! Important boundary:
//!
//! - this is not the upstream `imgui_impl_*` ABI
//! - the Rust-facing symbol names belong to this repository
//! - enabling a backend shim feature does not imply a safe wrapper exists in
//!   `dear-imgui-rs`
//!
//! Platform / feature gating:
//!
//! - `android` requires `target_os = "android"` and feature
//!   `backend-shim-android`
//! - `opengl3` requires feature `backend-shim-opengl3` and is currently
//!   available on non-wasm targets
//! - `win32` requires `target_os = "windows"` and feature
//!   `backend-shim-win32`
//! - `dx11` requires `target_os = "windows"` and feature
//!   `backend-shim-dx11`
//!
//! Typical usage patterns:
//!
//! - low-level Android apps can combine `backend_shim::android` and
//!   `backend_shim::opengl3` while keeping EGL / GLES setup and APK packaging
//!   in the application
//! - backend crates such as SDL3 wrappers may still own framework-specific
//!   build logic while reusing shared shim ABI where appropriate
//! - SDL3 renderer shims are owned by `dear-imgui-sdl3`; the sys-level
//!   renderer shim features are not exposed by `dear-imgui-sys`
//!
//! The repository's concrete Android proof-of-shape lives in
//! `examples-android/dear-imgui-android-smoke/`.
