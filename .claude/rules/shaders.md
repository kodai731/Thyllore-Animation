# Shader System

## Compiling Shaders

Shaders are compiled by `crates/thyllore-vulkan-core/build.rs` during `cargo build`: every shader file in `shaders/`
is compiled to `assets/shaders/` with glslc from VulkanSDK, verified against its GLSL declarations, and reflected.
Stale `.spv` files with no matching source are removed automatically.

## Shader Source Files

Shader source files are located in `shaders/` and its subdirectories; `build.rs` walks the tree and mirrors each
source directory under `assets/shaders/`, so file names only have to be unique inside their directory:

- `model/vertex.vert` -> `assets/shaders/model/vert.spv`
- `model/fragment.frag` -> `assets/shaders/model/frag.spv`
- `gbuffer/vertex.vert` -> `assets/shaders/gbuffer/vert.spv`
- `gbuffer/fragment.frag` -> `assets/shaders/gbuffer/frag.spv`
- `raytracing/rayQueryShadow.comp` -> `assets/shaders/raytracing/rayQueryShadowComp.spv`
- `water/causticSplat.comp` -> `assets/shaders/water/causticSplatComp.spv`
- etc.

Feature-specific shaders live in a subdirectory with their own `include/` (`shaders/water/`, `shaders/water/include/`);
shared includes live in `shaders/include/` (`common.glsl` holds `PI` / `TWO_PI` / `HALF_PI`; never re-declare them).
glslc runs with `-I shaders`, so every `#include` is written as a path from the `shaders/` root
(`#include "include/common.glsl"`, `#include "water/include/lb.glsl"`). `passes.toml` references stages by their
path relative to `shaders/` (`water/resolveFragment.frag`).

## Pass Manifest (`shaders/passes.toml`)

`shaders/passes.toml` is the only hand-written pass definition. Each `[pass.<name>]` lists its `stages`
(source paths relative to `shaders/`; the stage is derived from the extension) and `sets` (set index -> role:
`frame` = 0, `material` = 1, `object` = 2, `local` = pass-owned). `crates/thyllore-vulkan-core/build.rs` validates the file
(missing source, orphan shader not referenced by any pass, bad stage composition, role/set convention) and
generates `PassId`, `PassShaders` constants and `ALL_PASSES` into `$OUT_DIR/pass_manifest.rs`.

- Create pipelines with `PipelineBuilder::from_pass(&FLAME_RESOLVE)` / `RRPipeline::new_compute_with_push_constants(.., &RAY_QUERY_SHADOW, ..)`.
- Declare layouts with `ReflectedLayoutSpec::shared(SetRole::Frame)` or `ReflectedLayoutSpec::local(&TONEMAP)`.
- `ReflectedLayoutSpec::for_role(pass, role)` derives the spec of any pass set from the manifest alone; the
  test `block_definition.rs` walks `ALL_PASSES` with it, so no Rust-side pass list exists.
- Adding a shader = GLSL + `passes.toml` entry + its `*DescriptorSet`.

## Generated Binding Constants (`shader_bindings`)

`thyllore-vulkan-core/build.rs` also generates `$OUT_DIR/shader_bindings.rs` from the SPIR-V reflection: one
`pub mod <pass_name>` per pass with one `pub const <NAME>: ShaderBinding { set, binding, kind, count }` per
descriptor, named from the GLSL identifier (`historySampler` -> `HISTORY_SAMPLER`). Two stages of one pass declaring
the same (set, binding) under different names is a build error. No hand-written `*_BINDING: u32` constants exist;
renaming a descriptor in GLSL breaks the Rust build at the referencing site.

- Write descriptors through `layout.writer(set).buffer(flame_resolve::FLAME, ..)` — the writer takes `ShaderBinding`
  and rejects a kind that the layout slot does not accept.
- `ReflectedLayoutSpec::with_override(shader_bindings::.., vk::DescriptorType::..)` overrides a descriptor type.
- `PipelineBuilder::descriptor_layouts(&[&ReflectedSetLayout])` / `RRPipeline::new_compute*` verify at pipeline
  creation that every (set, binding) used by the pass shaders exists in the given layouts with a matching type.

## Shader Modifications

After editing shaders in `shaders/`, the build system automatically compiles them to `assets/shaders/` directory during
`cargo build`. The application loads compiled shaders from `assets/shaders/` directory.
