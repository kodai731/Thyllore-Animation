# Testing

## CI-Verified Tests Must Live Under `crates/thyllore-grpc-client/tests/`

**IMPORTANT:** Any test that must be verified by GitHub Actions MUST be placed under
`crates/thyllore-grpc-client/tests/` (or another lightweight workspace crate that does
not depend on the main `thyllore-animation` crate).

### Reason

The workspace root crate (`thyllore-animation`) depends on `vendor/imgui-sys`, whose
`build.rs` is intentionally NOT tracked in git (covered by `vendor/` in `.gitignore`).
GitHub Actions runners therefore CANNOT compile the root crate — any `cargo test` that
forces the root crate to build will fail with:

```
error: couldn't read `vendor/imgui-sys/build.rs`: No such file or directory
```

Tests placed under `tests/` at the workspace root require the root crate to compile and
will break CI.

### How to Apply

When adding a new integration test that should run in CI:

1. Place the test file under `crates/thyllore-grpc-client/tests/` (or another core crate
   without a vendored-imgui dependency, e.g., `thyllore-math-core`, `thyllore-anim-core`).
2. Reference workspace-root paths via `env!("CARGO_MANIFEST_DIR")` and walk up to the
   workspace root:
   ```rust
   fn workspace_root() -> PathBuf {
       Path::new(env!("CARGO_MANIFEST_DIR"))
           .ancestors()
           .nth(2)
           .expect("workspace root")
           .to_path_buf()
   }
   ```
3. Invoke the test in the workflow with `-p <crate-name>`:
   ```yaml
   cargo test -p thyllore-grpc-client --features <feature> --test <test_name>
   ```
4. Keep `[dev-dependencies]` (e.g., `tonic`, `tokio`) on the sub-crate, NOT on the
   workspace root, to avoid pulling them into root-crate builds.

### When Tests Belong at Workspace Root

`tests/` at the workspace root is for tests that intentionally exercise the full main
crate (e.g., `gltf_export_tests.rs`, `ecs_tests.rs`). These can ONLY run on developer
machines where `vendor/imgui-sys/build.rs` exists locally. They must NOT be wired into
GitHub Actions workflows.

## CI Reproduction — Run `scripts/collect_wheels.sh` Before Pushing

**IMPORTANT:** Before pushing any change that touches `crates/thyllore-ml-core`,
`pybindings/`, the blender addon, or anything affecting wheel builds, reproduce
the GitHub Actions wheel build locally:

```bash
scripts/collect_wheels.sh                 # production wheel (no debug-log)
scripts/collect_wheels.sh --debug-log     # debug wheel (addon file logging)
```

This runs the same maturin invocation CI does and surfaces compile errors
directly. Local turnaround is ~30s incremental vs minutes per CI round-trip.

### ML path: v2 curve-copilot only

The only supported ML inference path is the **v2 curve-copilot** model
(`V2CurveCopilotSession` / `forecast`, under `copilot::v2::`,
`curve_copilot_20260630_v2_k48opt.onnx`). v2 is reveal-none extrapolation:
4 ONNX inputs (`context` / `context_times` / `future_times` / `context_tangent`,
all `[batch, 64]`), no `future` / `reveal_mask`. The Rust runtime does the
deploy-safe z-score over the context (std floor 0.05, clip ±8), builds the
seconds-based times and the finite-difference tangent, and denormalizes the
`mean_curve` output. The v1 7-input surface (ctx32 + reveal) and the pre-v1
multi-input copilot surface have been removed. `ABI_MARKER = 2` was the v2
baseline; it was bumped to 3 when `build_forecast_preview` gained the
`full_token` parameter (mode B ctx64 degrade gate).

Bit-parity against the training export is verified by
`cargo test -p thyllore-ml-core --test v2_curve_copilot_golden_parity -- --ignored`
(needs `THYLLORE_SHARED_DATA_DIR`; fixture
`exports/curve_copilot_20260630_v2_k48opt_golden.json`).

A structurally-correct all-zero dummy model is published on HuggingFace
(`kodai731/thyllore-curve-copilot`, fixed name `curve_copilot_dummy.onnx`;
the production weights live in the same private repo as
`curve_copilot_prod.onnx`, used only by the release workflow). The
`v2-curve-copilot-smoke` CI job downloads it and asserts only that inference runs
and returns finite values — not numeric parity with the production model. Run the
same check locally with `scripts/ci_v2_curve_copilot_inference_smoke.sh`.

### Local verification for ML / addon changes

| What changed | Local check |
|---|---|
| `crates/thyllore-ml-core/src/**` (v2 inference / forecast / pybindings) | `cargo test -p thyllore-ml-core --lib` + `scripts/collect_wheels.sh` |
| Blender addon (`blender_addon/**`) | `scripts/run_blender_debug.sh` — builds the debug wheel + addon, installs, launches the test scene; the operator smoke runs headless via `blender_addon/tests/curve_copilot_operator_smoke.py` |
| engine ML systems (`src/ecs/systems/curve_copilot/`, `src/ml/`) | `cargo check --lib` + `cargo test --lib curve_suggestion` |
| Animation / ECS / rendering (no ML) | `cargo test --lib` + `cargo test --test ecs_tests --no-default-features` |

ONNX Runtime must be present at `vendor/onnxruntime/onnxruntime-linux-x64-*/lib/`
and `ORT_DYLIB_PATH` set (see `.cargo/config.toml`) for any test that loads a model.

### When CI is Still the Right Choice

- The bug only reproduces on macOS/arm64 hardware not available locally.
- A platform-specific Windows or macOS path must be exercised end-to-end.

In all other cases, exhaust the local reproduction first.

## Workspace-root `tests/`

Integration tests that exercise the full main crate. They run only on developer machines (see above) and
always with `--no-default-features` (the `ml` feature's `ort` dependency can crash a test binary at startup,
see `CLAUDE.md`):

- `ecs_tests.rs` — ECS world, systems and scene round trips
- `gltf_export_tests.rs`, `animation_roundtrip_tests.rs` — export / re-import parity
- `asset_dependency_tests.rs`, `closed_form_guard.rs` — invariants over assets and the analytic core
- `integration_tests.rs`, `model_loading_tests.rs`, `shader_tests.rs` — project structure, model files,
  compiled SPIR-V
- `compare_fbx_dom.rs`, `compare_fbx_structure.rs`, `inspect_fbx_binary.rs` — FBX inspection helpers

Do not record test counts in documentation; they change with every PR. The current numbers are the output
of the commands below.

## Running Tests

```bash
cargo test --lib                                        # lib tests (ml enabled, safe)
cargo test --test ecs_tests --no-default-features       # one integration test binary
cargo test --no-default-features                        # every test with ml disabled
cargo test -p thyllore-grpc-client --no-default-features
cargo test --lib -- --nocapture                         # with output
cargo test -p thyllore-ml-core --test v2_curve_copilot_golden_parity -- --ignored
```

Never run `cargo test` or `cargo test --test <name>` with the default features: the integration binaries
link `ort` and may crash before the first test.

## Build + Test (Windows)

`build-with-tests.ps1` runs the build and the three safe invocations above sequentially and saves the
results to `log/log_test.txt`:

```powershell
.\build-with-tests.ps1            # Build and run tests
.\build-with-tests.ps1 -Release   # Release build
.\build-with-tests.ps1 -SkipTests # Skip tests
```
