#![cfg(test)]

//! Holds the Rust router to the decisions the Python evaluation driver reached.
//!
//! The published route accuracy was measured by `AnimationModelTraining scripts/helm_router/`, so
//! the Rust port is only as good as its agreement with it. Every step can differ
//! quietly — a tokenizer that adds different special tokens, pooling that counts
//! padding, an aggregation that averages instead of taking the best exemplar, a
//! tie-break that reads a different table — and each one would move the engine off
//! the number without breaking anything visible.
//!
//! `export_router_index.py` writes `router_parity.json` next to the model: the
//! route and score that driver produced for all 202 labelled utterances. This
//! replays them through the Rust encoder, the Rust ranker and the Rust tie-break.
//!
//! Requires THYLLORE_ROUTER_MODEL_DIR pointing at a model directory holding
//! `tokenizer.json`, `onnx/model.onnx` and the three files that export writes, plus
//! ORT_DYLIB_PATH resolving to the vendored runtime.
//!
//! A developer-machine test, not a CI one: it needs both the root crate (which CI
//! cannot compile, see `.claude/rules/testing.md`) and a trained encoder that is
//! not in the repository. Do not wire it into a workflow.
