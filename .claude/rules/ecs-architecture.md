# ECS Architecture

**IMPORTANT:** MUST follow these architecture rules when adding files, code, or planning new features.

This project uses an Entity-Component-System (ECS) architecture. The design follows these principles:

## Design Philosophy

1. **Data-Behavior Separation**: Data structures hold only data; all behavior is implemented as system functions
2. **Composition over Inheritance**: Build complex objects by combining simple components
3. **Single Responsibility**: Each component/system has one clear purpose
4. **Components/Systems Directory Separation**: Within a feature domain, data types and logic are separated
   into `components/` and `systems/` subdirectories (inspired by Unity DOTS and Flecs module patterns)
5. **Small, Atomic Components**: Prefer multiple small components over one large component.
   Components that are always accessed together may share a struct, but data accessed by different systems
   should be in separate components (Flecs design principle: reduces cache misses and unnecessary data loading)
6. **Module Independence**: Feature modules depend on shared component types, not on each other's system
   functions. Inter-module communication happens through components, resources, and events — never through
   direct system-to-system calls across module boundaries (Flecs module design)

## Directory Structure

### Core ECS Layer (`src/ecs/`)

```
src/ecs/
├── component/           # Component definitions (data attached to entities)
├── bundle/              # Common component combinations
├── resource/            # Global dynamic state (changes per frame)
├── systems/             # System functions (behavior/logic)
│   └── phases/          # Phase coordinators (execution order)
├── events/              # Event definitions
├── world.rs             # World container for entities and resources
├── query.rs             # Query functions for entity filtering
└── mod.rs
```

### Domain ECS Modules

Feature-specific domains that have their own data/logic separation follow the `components/` and `systems/`
pattern within their module directory.

```

│   ├── keyframe.rs      # EditableKeyframe, BezierHandle, TangentType, etc.
│   ├── curve.rs         # PropertyCurve, PropertyType (data + accessors only)
│   ├── track.rs         # BoneTrack (data + accessors only)
│   ├── clip.rs          # EditableAnimationClip (data + accessors only)
│   ├── blend.rs         # BlendMode, EaseType

└── mod.rs
```

### What Goes in `components/`

- Struct and enum definitions (data types)
- `new()`, `Default`, `Clone`, `Serialize`/`Deserialize` derives
- Simple accessors: `get_*()`, `set_*()`, field access helpers
- Computed properties that read but do not mutate (e.g., `effective_duration()`, `is_empty()`)
- Collection helpers on owned data (e.g., `contains_instance()`, `add_instance()` for Vec operations)

### What Goes in `systems/`

- Pure functions that compute, transform, or sample data (e.g., `curve_sample`, `sample_bezier`)
- Functions that mutate state across multiple data structures (e.g., `recalculate_tangent_at`)
- Format conversion functions (e.g., `from_animation_clip`, `to_animation_clip`)
- I/O operations (e.g., `save_to_file`, `load_from_file`)
- Functions that coordinate operations across multiple components

## Core Concepts

### Components

Data-only structs attached to entities. Located in `ecs/component/`.

### Resources

Global state that changes per frame. Located in `ecs/resource/`. **Only use for dynamic data.**

Resources correspond to **singleton components** in other ECS frameworks:
- Flecs: singletons (component added to its own entity)
- Unity DOTS: singleton components (`GetSingleton<T>()`)
- EnTT: context variables (`registry.ctx()`)

### Systems

Pure functions that operate on components and resources. Located in `ecs/systems/`.

```rust
pub fn camera_rotate(camera: &mut Camera, delta: Vector2<f32>);
pub fn animation_update(playback: &mut AnimationPlayback, registry: &mut AnimationRegistry, dt: f32);
```

### Bundles

Predefined component combinations for common entity types. Located in `ecs/bundle/`.

## Phase Pipeline

Systems execute in a fixed phase order, defined in `src/ecs/systems/phases/`. Each phase is a coordinator
function that calls the appropriate systems in sequence.

```
run_frame()
├── run_input_phase()              # Input handling, gizmo interaction
├── run_transform_phase_ecs()      # Transform propagation
├── run_animation_phase_ecs()      # Animation evaluation, blending, skinning
├── run_onion_skin_phase()         # Ghost frame generation
├── run_render_prep_phase()        # Gizmo mesh building, render data collection
└── run_event_dispatch_phase()     # UI event processing, deferred actions
```

### Phase Design Principles (from Flecs, Unity DOTS, Bevy)

- **Phases are sequential**: Each phase completes before the next begins
- **Systems within a phase may have internal ordering**: Expressed through call sequence in the phase
  coordinator function
- **Animation completes before Transform propagation**: Standard in all major engines
  (Bevy: `.before(TransformSystems::Propagate)`, Unity DOTS: animation in SimulationSystemGroup
  before TransformSystemGroup)
- **Event dispatch is last**: Deferred structural changes (entity creation/destruction, component
  add/remove) are processed at the end of the frame, similar to Unity DOTS EntityCommandBuffer
  pattern and Flecs sync points

### Adding New Phases

When adding a new phase:
1. Create a coordinator function in `phases/`
2. The function receives `FrameContext` and calls system functions in order
3. Add the call in `run_frame()` at the correct position
4. Document ordering dependencies (what must complete before this phase)

## Query Pattern

Use query functions instead of storing entity IDs:

```rust
pub fn query_grid(world: &World) -> Option<Entity>;
pub fn query_selectable_entities(world: &World) -> Vec<Entity>;
```

For frequently called queries, consider caching results in a resource to avoid repeated iteration
(analogous to Flecs cached queries vs uncached queries).

## RefCell-Based Interior Mutability

```rust
let camera = app.resource::<Camera>();           // ResRef<Camera> (immutable)
let mut camera = app.resource_mut::<Camera>();   // ResMut<Camera> (mutable)
```

## Adding New Scene Objects

1. Define components in `ecs/component/`
2. Create a bundle in `ecs/bundle/`
3. Add a marker component for queries
4. Implement system functions in `ecs/systems/`
5. Spawn entity with the bundle in initialization

## Adding New Domain Features

When a feature domain has enough data types and logic to warrant separation:

1. Create `<domain>/components/` for data types
2. Create `<domain>/systems/` for logic functions
3. Keep `<domain>/mod.rs` for re-exports only
4. Data types must not depend on system functions
5. System functions import and operate on data types

## Layer Boundary Rules

**IMPORTANT:** ECS business logic MUST live inside `src/ecs/systems/`. Code outside `src/ecs/` (especially
`src/platform/`, `src/app/`) must NOT contain ECS domain logic.

### Dependency Direction

Following Flecs module design, dependencies flow in one direction:

```
Platform Layer (src/platform/, src/app/)
    │  reads resources, sends events, calls phase entry points
    ▼
ECS Systems Layer (src/ecs/systems/)
    │  calls pure domain functions, operates on components/resources
    ▼
Domain Layer (src/animation/editable/, src/animation/)
    │  pure data types and pure functions, no World dependency
    ▼
Core Types (src/ecs/component/, src/ecs/resource/)
    data definitions only
```

**Allowed in platform layer** (`src/platform/`):
- Reading resources for UI display (immutable access)
- Sending events to `UIEventQueue`
- Calling a single ECS dispatch entry point (e.g., `run_event_dispatch_phase`)
- Platform-specific I/O (file dialogs, window management, imgui orchestration)
- Handling `DeferredAction` that requires `App`/`GUIData`

**NOT allowed in platform layer**:
- Directly calling multiple ECS system functions to process events
- Match-dispatching `UIEvent` variants to mutate `World`/`AssetStorage`
- Implementing event handler logic inline
- Using `resource_mut` or `get_component_mut` for business logic mutations

### Domain Layer Independence

Domain modules (`src/animation/editable/`) must be **pure** — no dependency on `World`, `Entity`,
`AssetStorage`, or `GraphicsResources`. This enables:
- Unit testing without ECS infrastructure
- Reuse across different ECS contexts
- Clear separation between "what the data is" and "how the engine uses it"

## Event System

Events follow a **record-then-dispatch** pattern (similar to Unity DOTS EntityCommandBuffer
and Flecs deferred events):

1. **Platform layer** records events into `UIEventQueue` (immutable World access only)
2. **Event dispatch phase** processes all queued events (mutable World access)
3. **Structural changes** (entity creation/destruction) happen only during dispatch

This prevents mutation during iteration and ensures deterministic ordering.

## Bones are NOT Entities

- Bones are data within `Skeleton.bones: Vec<Bone>`
- Bones identified by `BoneId` (u32 index), not `Entity`
- Constraints reference bones via `BoneId`

This is a deliberate design choice: skeleton data is a small, structured hierarchy that benefits from
contiguous memory (Vec) rather than ECS entity overhead. Flecs also recognizes this pattern —
small structural hierarchies can use optimized storage rather than full entity relationships.
